# React frontend

## Requirements
You must have `npm`/`nodejs` installed. Check https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
for tips if you are unfamiliar

For back-end download project from https://github.com/larsq/workshop-moviedb.
Follow the instruction how to install and run it.

## Installing
run `npm install` from directory

## Running
The simplest way of running it, use `npm run start`, these will build
and expose the interface on http://localhost:4200. The code can, of
course be built, and exposed through a web-server. This project will
not provide any instruction how to achieve this

## How to use
The code is committed ino steps where a prototype (consiting of static
HTML) is transformed into a Angular application. By checking out a former git
commit (by `git checkout` command), the user may do the transformation by its own
and uses the proceeding steps as a solution suggestion. It is not really a stand-alone
study guide or tutorial but may provide an example application to explore the corner-stones
of Angular framework
